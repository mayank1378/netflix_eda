# üìä The_iScale Movies Data Analysis Project
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# üéØ Objective:
# Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a curated movie dataset
# to uncover insights about genre frequency, vote patterns, popularity scores,
# and release trends. Clean and transform the data for meaningful visualizations.

# üìÇ Dataset Overview:
# - Source: 'mymoviedb.csv'
# - Original Rows: 9827
# - Final Rows after genre explosion: 25,552
# - Columns used: Release_Date, Title, Popularity, Vote_Count, Vote_Average, Genre

# üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps:
# 1. Dropped irrelevant columns: 'Overview', 'Original_Language', 'Poster_Url'
# 2. Converted 'Release_Date' to year only
# 3. Categorized 'Vote_Average' into 4 bins:
#    ['not_popular', 'below_avg', 'average', 'popular']
# 4. Split multi-genre entries and exploded them into separate rows
# 5. Dropped any remaining NaNs

# ‚ùì Key Questions Explored:
# Q1: What is the most frequent genre in the dataset?
# Q2: Which genres have the highest vote averages?
# Q3: Which movie has the highest popularity score?
# Q4: Which movie has the lowest popularity score?
# Q5: Which year saw the most movie releases?

# üìä Visualizations Created:
# - Genre distribution bar chart
# - Vote average category count plot
# - Popularity histogram
# - Yearly release distribution

# üß† Insights:
# - Drama is the most frequent and most popular genre
# - Popularity and vote count are not always aligned
# - Genre explosion revealed multi-genre patterns
# - Categorizing vote averages made comparisons more intuitive

# ‚úÖ Final Dataset Shape:
# - Rows: 25,552
# - Columns: 6 (Release_Date, Title, Popularity, Vote_Count, Vote_Average, Genre)

# 1. Exploring Data

# Importing libraries
import numpy as np  # type: ignore
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Reading the file
df = pd.read_csv('mymoviedb.csv', lineterminator="\n")

# View the dataset and datatypes information
print(df.info())

# It suggests that our data has no NaN values. Overview, language, and poster_url are not as useful for us.
# Release_date needs to be casted into date and time.

# Explore genres column
print(df['Genre'].head(10))

# Checking for the duplicates
print("Duplicate rows:", df.duplicated().sum())

# Statistical summary
print(df.describe())

# --- Exploration summary ---
# The dataset contains information about 9,827 movies, each described by 9 features such as title, release date, overview, popularity, vote count, average vote, original language, genre, and poster URL.
# There are no missing values in any column, and the dataset does not contain duplicate rows.
# The 'Genre' column includes multiple genres per movie, and the 'Release_Date' is currently stored as an object (string) rather than a datetime type.
# Numerical columns like 'Popularity', 'Vote_Count', and 'Vote_Average' have been summarized to understand their distributions.
# Overall, the data is clean and ready for further analysis or preprocessing steps.
