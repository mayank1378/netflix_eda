This project explores a movie dataset through EDA, revealing genre trends, vote patterns, and popularity insights. After cleaning and exploding multi-genre entries, visualizations show drama as dominant, vote-popularity mismatches, and yearly release spikes. Categorized ratings and transformed features enable clearer, more intuitive comparisons.
